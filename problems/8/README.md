# myAtoi

## Notes

This implementation operates similarly to the C function.

## Instructions

Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

* Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
* Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.
 * Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
 * Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.

Return the integer as the final result.

## C atoi

Parses the C-string str interpreting its content as an integral number, which is returned as a value of type int.

The function first discards as many whitespace characters (as in isspace) as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many base-10 digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed and zero is returned.
